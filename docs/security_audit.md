  - ECDSA for key generation and signing
  - Secure key storage with encryption
  - Key rotation policies
  - Hardware security module (HSM) support

- **Hash Functions**
  - SHA-256 for block hashing
  - Double-hashing for transaction verification
  - Merkle tree implementation for block validation

### 2. Network Security
- **P2P Network**
  - TLS encryption for all peer connections
  - Rate limiting for peer connections
  - IP-based blacklisting
  - Message validation and sanitization

- **RPC Interface**
  - Authentication for RPC endpoints
  - Rate limiting per IP/client
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - CORS configuration

### 3. Consensus Security
- **Proof of Work**
  - Difficulty adjustment algorithm
  - Block validation rules
  - Chain reorganization protection
  - 51% attack prevention measures

- **Transaction Validation**
  - Double-spend prevention
  - Transaction fee validation
  - Script validation
  - UTXO verification

### 4. Data Security
- **Storage**
  - Encrypted wallet storage
  - Secure key derivation
  - Backup and recovery procedures
  - Data integrity checks

- **Privacy**
  - Address reuse prevention

# Brigham Young Chain (BYC) Monetary System

## Introduction

The Brigham Young Chain (BYC) is a revolutionary dual-blockchain system inspired by the ancient Nephite monetary system, as described in the Book of Mormon. This document explains how the system works, its economic principles, and how to use it in daily life.

## Historical Inspiration

### The Nephite Monetary System
The BYC draws inspiration from the sophisticated monetary system used by the ancient Nephites, which featured:
- A dual-metal system (gold and silver)
- Multiple denominations with specific exchange rates
- A system designed for both daily commerce and larger transactions
- Built-in mechanisms to prevent inflation and maintain value

### Modern Adaptation
BYC modernizes these principles by:
- Using blockchain technology for security and transparency
- Implementing smart contracts for automated exchanges
- Creating a digital equivalent of the dual-metal system
- Maintaining the original economic principles in a digital age

## The Dual Blockchain System

### Golden Chain
- Primary chain for high-value transactions
- Focuses on stability and security
- Processes larger transactions
- Used for cross-chain operations

### Silver Chain
- Secondary chain for daily transactions
- Optimized for speed and efficiency
- Handles smaller, frequent transactions
- Used for micro-payments

## Coin System

### Base Mining Coins (Available on Both Chains)

1. **Leah** (Base Unit)
   - Easiest to mine
   - Used for basic transactions
   - Serves as the foundation for derived coins
   - Mining difficulty: Low
   - Block time: ~2 minutes

2. **Shiblum** (2x Value)
   - Medium difficulty to mine
   - Used for medium-sized transactions
   - Value: 2 Leah
   - Mining difficulty: Medium
   - Block time: ~4 minutes

3. **Shiblon** (4x Value)
   - Hardest to mine
   - Used for large transactions
   - Value: 4 Leah
   - Mining difficulty: High
   - Block time: ~8 minutes

### Gold-based Derived Units

1. **Senine**
   - Derived from Leah
   - Used for small transactions
   - Value: 1 Leah

2. **Seon**

   - Used for governance and staking

2. **Manasseh**
   - Created when a Silver Block is completed
   - Limited supply: 15 million
   - Cannot be transferred between chains
   - Used for governance and staking

3. **Joseph**
   - Created by combining 1 Ephraim + 1 Manasseh
   - Limited supply: 3 million
   - Used for cross-chain governance
   - Highest value special coin

## Mining System

### Mining Process
1. Choose mining difficulty (Leah, Shiblum, or Shiblon)
2. Select target chain (Golden or Silver)
3. Start mining process
4. Receive rewards based on difficulty

### Mining Options
1. **Solo Mining**
   - Mine independently
   - Keep all rewards
   - Higher variance in earnings
   - Good for small-scale miners

2. **Pool Mining**
   - Mine with others
   - Share rewards
   - More consistent earnings
   - Better for small miners

### Mining Rewards
- Leah: Base reward
- Shiblum: 2x base reward
- Shiblon: 4x base reward
- Block completion coins: Additional rewards

## Daily Usage

### Basic Transactions
1. **Small Purchases** (Leah/Senum)
   - Daily goods
   - Small services
   - Micro-transactions

2. **Medium Purchases** (Shiblum/Amnor)
   - Electronics
   - Services
   - Regular payments

3. **Large Purchases** (Shiblon/Ezrom)
   - Real estate
   - Vehicles
   - Major investments

### Cross-Chain Transactions
1. Use Antion for transfers
2. Convert between chains
3. Access both economies
4. Maximize value

### Special Uses
1. **Governance**

# BYC Blockchain Network

This document describes the network architecture and features of the BYC Blockchain.

## Overview

The BYC Blockchain network is a peer-to-peer network that enables nodes to communicate, share blocks, and propagate transactions. The network is designed to be secure, reliable, and efficient.

## Network Architecture

### Node Types

1. **Full Nodes**
   - Maintain a complete copy of the blockchain
   - Participate in block validation and consensus
   - Relay transactions and blocks to other nodes

2. **Light Nodes**
   - Maintain a partial copy of the blockchain
   - Rely on full nodes for block and transaction data
   - Can verify transactions and blocks

3. **Bootstrap Nodes**
   - Special nodes that help new nodes join the network
   - Maintain a list of active peers
   - Provide initial peer discovery

### Connection Types

1. **Inbound Connections**
   - Connections initiated by other nodes
   - Limited by MaxPeers configuration
   - Subject to rate limiting and security checks

2. **Outbound Connections**
   - Connections initiated by this node
   - Used to connect to bootstrap nodes and discovered peers
   - Maintained for block and transaction propagation

## Security Features

### TLS Encryption

All network connections are encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher with the following features:
- ECDHE key exchange
- AES-256-GCM encryption
- SHA-384 message authentication
- Certificate-based peer authentication

### Message Signing

All messages are signed using ECDSA with the following features:
- SHA-256 message hashing
- P-256 curve for key generation
- Nonce-based replay protection
- Signature verification on message receipt

### Rate Limiting

Network connections are protected by rate limiting:
- Per-IP connection limits
- Message rate limits
- Burst handling
- Automatic cleanup of old entries

## Network Features

### Peer Discovery

1. **Bootstrap Process**
   - Connect to bootstrap nodes
   - Request peer list
   - Validate and connect to discovered peers

2. **Peer Maintenance**
   - Regular peer health checks
   - Automatic peer removal on failure
   - Peer list exchange with connected peers

### Connection Multiplexing

1. **Stream Management**
   - Multiple logical streams over single connection
   - Priority-based stream handling
   - Flow control and backpressure

2. **Message Compression**
   - GZIP compression for large messages
   - Configurable compression thresholds
   - Automatic decompression

### Network Partition Handling

1. **Partition Detection**
   - Regular connectivity checks
   - Peer health monitoring
   - Partition state tracking

2. **Recovery Procedures**
   - Automatic reconnection attempts
   - Peer list refresh
   - State synchronization

## Message Types

1. **Control Messages**
   - Ping/Pong for connectivity checks
   - Peer discovery requests
   - Peer list exchange

2. **Blockchain Messages**
   - Block propagation
   - Transaction broadcasting
   - State synchronization

## Configuration

### Network Configuration

```go
type NetworkConfig struct {
    NodeID         string   // Unique node identifier
    ListenPort     int      // Port to listen for incoming connections
    MaxPeers       int      // Maximum number of peers
    BootstrapPeers []string // List of bootstrap nodes
}
```

### Security Configuration

```go
type SecureConfig struct {
    CertFile     string   // Path to certificate file
    KeyFile      string   // Path to private key file
    CAFile       string   // Path to CA certificate file
    VerifyPeer   bool     // Whether to verify peer certificates
    MinVersion   uint16   // Minimum TLS version
    CipherSuites []uint16 // Allowed cipher suites
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Security**
   - Always use TLS for connections
   - Verify peer certificates
   - Sign all messages
   - Implement rate limiting

2. **Performance**
   - Use connection multiplexing

   - Implement proper flow control
   - Monitor network metrics

3. **Reliability**
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use timeouts for operations
   - Handle network partitions
   - Maintain peer health

4. **Monitoring**
   - Track connection statistics
   - Monitor message rates
   - Log security events
   - Track partition events

a) Network Layer:
Bootstrap node discovery mechanism
Peer discovery protocol
Network synchronization
Connection pool management
Network security hardening
b) Consensus:
Difficulty adjustment algorithm
Fork resolution mechanism
Chain reorganization handling
Network-wide consensus rules
c) Security:
Rate limiting implementation
DDoS protection
Transaction fee mechanism
Network message validation
Peer reputation system
d) Storage:
Block pruning implementation
UTXO set optimization
Transaction batching
Data compression
Backup and recovery
e) Testing:
Network stress tests
Security tests

Load testing
Current Limitations:
a) Mining:
Basic proof-of-work implementation
No difficulty adjustment
Limited mining pool support
No reward halving mechanism
b) Transactions:
Basic transaction validation
No fee market
Limited transaction types
No smart contract support
c) Network:
Basic P2P communication
No peer discovery
Limited network security
No bandwidth management
What Users Can Do Now:
a) Basic Operations:
Create and manage wallets
Mine blocks (basic implementation)
Send and receive transactions
View blockchain status
Monitor network status
b) Limitations:
No guarantee of network consensus
Limited security features
Basic transaction processing
No advanced features (smart contracts, tokens)

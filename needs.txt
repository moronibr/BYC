Error Handling and Recovery
While there is a basic error handling system in place (internal/core/security/error_handler.go), it needs enhancement:
Implement more specific error types for different scenarios
Add proper error recovery mechanisms
Improve error reporting and notification system
Add circuit breakers for critical operations

Logging and Monitoring
The logging system (internal/logger/logger.go) is well-structured but needs:
Complete log aggregation implementation
Enhanced log rotation with better retention policies
Structured logging for better analysis
Integration with external monitoring systems

Metrics and Performance Monitoring
The metrics system (internal/core/monitoring/metrics.go) needs:
Complete implementation of system metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
Network latency measurement implementation
Better performance metrics collection
Integration with Prometheus/Grafana

Security Enhancements
Several security features need to be implemented:
Proper key management system
Secure address generation
Transaction signing improvements
Rate limiting for all RPC endpoints
Authentication system for RPC calls

Testing and Quality Assurance
While there are some tests, more comprehensive testing is needed:
Complete unit test coverage
Integration tests
Load testing
Security testing
Performance benchmarking

Documentation
Need to add:
API documentation
Deployment guides
Configuration documentation
Security best practices
Troubleshooting guides

Performance Optimization
Several performance improvements needed:
Implement proper caching mechanisms
Add database indexing
Optimize batch processing
Improve memory management
Add connection pooling

Backup and Recovery
The backup system (internal/core/monitoring/backup.go) needs:
Automated backup scheduling
Backup verification
Recovery procedures
Disaster recovery plans

Configuration Management
Need to implement:
Environment-specific configurations
Dynamic configuration updates
Configuration validation
Secure configuration storage

Deployment and Operations
Need to add:
Containerization support
Kubernetes manifests
CI/CD pipelines
Deployment automation
Health checks
Service discovery
